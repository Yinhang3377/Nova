# Nova
A new beginning

## Nova (monorepo) - initial scaffold

This repository is a scaffold for the Nova blockchain project. It contains:

- `nova-core`: Core primitives and runtime components
- `nova-cli`: Command-line interface for wallets and node control
- `docs`: Design documents and roadmap
- `test-utils`: Test harness and simulators

This scaffold is intentionally minimal and designed to be expanded per the Nova project outline.
